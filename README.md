# Infix Expression Evaluator

This program accepts an input string of operands, operators, parentheses and brackets and outputs the result of the given infix expression. Implied multiplication (i.e. 5(4)) is not supported. This project was created and submitted for my Data Structures class at the University of Pittsburgh (CS 0445).
